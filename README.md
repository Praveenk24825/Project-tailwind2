This is a responsive, modern website inspired by Nexcent's design. Built with HTML and Tailwind CSS, it includes a sticky navbar, hero section, client logos, community cards, and a footer. The layout is mobile-friendly and uses a custom "Arica" font for typography. All UI components are structured with Tailwind utility classes for easy customization. No external CSS files are usedâ€”purely Tailwind-based styling. Images and icons can be replaced with your own branding assets.
